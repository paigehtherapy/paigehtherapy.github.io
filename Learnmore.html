                <h3>Working with Families</h3>
            </header>
            <p>As a family therapist I don't believe that our life happens in a vacuum. We develop in the context of our families. Sometimes family can be easy, but sometimes being a part of a family system can be a struggle. I love helping families to connect and communicate in ways that empower everyone as individuals and as a family system. Not all families look or act the same, so I am here to help you develop the family structure that is best for your family, including families effected by divorce or other forms of ending relationships.</p>

                <h3>Working with Children</h3>
            </header>
            <p>I love helping children discover who they are going to be. I also love empowering parents to feel confident. In my work with children I help them gain understanding about their thoughts, feelings, and actions, and educate them on ways to manage their feelings in ways that are healthy. I use a mixed approach of giving education to the child, practicing practical skills, and coaching parents in continued skill building. I make sure to infuse my time with children with fun, play, and exploration of their world. I have specific training in working with children experiencing depression, anxiety, defiant behaviors, ADHD, symptoms from traumatic experiences, Autism, and other developmental disorders. </p>

            <p>I enjoy working with individual adults regarding symptoms of depression, anxiety, life transitions, grief, and gaining emotional confidence and stability. My approach to therapy is rooted in current scientific research, and geared towards helping each individual to accomplish their goals.</p>

                    <h3>Working with Couples</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Research in the field of couples therapy is teaching us that having safe and loving attachments to others is just as important for adults as it is for children. I love working with couples to create safe and secure attachments whether you are just beginning your relationship, have hit a hard spot, are thinking of ending a relationship, or just want to be intentional about continuing to grow your relationship. I use a mix of Emotionally Focused Couples therapy, solution focused couples therapy, and a smattering of techniques from the Gottman institute. If you want to know more about any of those approaches, don't hesitate to ask.</p>
