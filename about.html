            <p>Hi! My name is Paige, and I am a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist, a Child Mental Health Specialist, and a Developmental Disabilities Specialist. I use well researched and evidence-based approaches to work with children, teens, individual adults, couples, and families. Many people seek out mental health therapy when something in their life isn't working the way they want it to. My approach is to help each person identify their goals, and work collaboratively and compassionately to accomplish those goals. I do not believe in a one size fits all model to therapy, so my approach to counseling will vary based on your goals, needs, and developmental lifestage.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>I have specific training in CBT, DBT, systemic family therapy approaches, Emotion Focused Couples Therapy, play therapy, and parent coaching.</p>
